   <h2>Things I like</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>I like to watch anime to download it I use <a class="hm" href="https://horriblesubs.info">horriblesubs</a> to download it.
    <li><a class="bold" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf4Tx84-0xQ"> This </a>is my favourite video on youtube.</li>
    <li>I like to play Apex Legends too even though I'm not very good at it.</li>

    <li>I like to listen to songs as well</li>
        but I'll talk about them later
    <li>I like to play overwatch too! Even though not as many people play it now compared to last time but it's still fun to play with my friends!</li>
        I like to play Genji! He's very mobile and can do a lot of damage, well if you can aim that is.
